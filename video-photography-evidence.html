                  Photography Basics
                </h4>
                <p class="card-text">Photography is simpler in terms of capturing an image, however when using a professional camera, there is far more factors influencing the quality than when recording a video piece. In particular the focus point of the image has a large impact on both the brightness, colour scheme and sharpness of a photo. Furthermore, the frame of the photo changes what the viewer sees, whether this be landscape which a narrow aperture is better for, or portrait, which a wide aperture is better for, and the ratio that the shot is taken in. Aperture is an opening through which light travels, helping to determine the level of exposure in the photograph. To begin with, we were introduced to the rule of thirds, which involves splitting the frame into three vertical lines and three horizontal lines, helping to place more emphasis on the subject of the photograph. In particular when taking photographs for my website, I found that the positioning and angle of my photos were important, with this helping affect the shadows and lighting in each picture. In an article on photography, it was suggested that ‘angles in photography, intentionally used, define voice, presence and visual purpose’, (Keefe, 2016), demonstrating the importance of this when capturing a specific shot..</p>

                  Video Production Basics
                </h4>
                <p class="card-text">While photography is purely focused on an individual image, and capturing one moment, video production has a lot more aspects to it, in terms of audio and the production quality. Videos appeal to more than just visual senses, meaning there are far more aspects that are covered when producing video footage, which was apparent early on whilst filming our footage for Match of the Day X; audio levels were particularly important, especially when filming outside, whilst the framing of images was also essential in order to produce a quality final product. Voiceovers had to be done effectively, to avoid any of this sound feeling out of place in our video piece, as ‘sound design is equal in importance to visual composition in creating effective audiovisual media’ (Taylor & Francis, 2017). White balance, which is the process of adjusting the colour balance of light in the shot was something that became more important when filming against the sun, in order to make this footage look as close to the real image as possible. The type of shot that we wanted to achieve could also be affected, with a tripod being used frequently in order to keep the camera still whilst filming, and to prevent poor video footage, particularly while filming in local parks. </p>

                  Social media delivery
                </h4>
                <p class="card-text">The delivery of a social media piece differs massively in comparison to a video production piece or a photography piece; this usually needs to be far more entertaining in order to bring more attention to what is often a shorter, snappier video. However, this can also be an entertaining image, if posted on media sites such as Instagram or Facebook. For our social media piece, we chose to upload this to Tiktok, in which one of the important factors of posting on this app, is that the video needs to instantly appeal to our intended audience; people scrolling aren’t often going to wait to see the outcome of a video, meaning this needs to instantly demonstrate the content or subject. We found it essential in terms of social media delivery that we knew our audience; for us, this an audience of 16-24 year olds, which the majority of which will use Tiktok, whereas if this was for older adults, Facebook would be a more ideal place for this piece.  Furthermore, ‘if you know what types of content your customers like and don’t like, you can avoid spending endless hours crafting irrelevant content that is likely to fall flat’ (Vaugh,2020). According to Statista (2021), 4.2 billion of the world’s population are active social media users, meaning this is an ideal place to document video footage or short social media pieces, which can help broadcast our video piece.</p>
