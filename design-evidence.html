              Typography
            </h4>
            <p class="card-text">Whilst designing my website, the typography used was an essential part of creating a professional and appealing layout and design; this website would be ideally shown to employers or those working in the creative industries, meaning it was essential I designed it well. For the general typography, I used the font ‘Unna’, which fits with the subject I have chosen, as well as the design of the website, and is appropriate for a professional website. Furthermore, when choosing suitable fonts, I had to occasionally choose distinct typeface’s, which are a collection of fonts; for example, when choosing ‘Unna’, I had to decide whether I wanted this font in italic, bold etc. or just the regular edition of the font. In an extract from ‘What is Typography?’, it is mentioned that ‘brands have to create their distinctive identities’ and that ‘graphic designers use typography as a potent tool to turn text into an impactful visual’ (Carton, 2020), in order to grab a customer’s attention. A font that is too complex or ‘fancy’ can put readers off, particularly if they are unable to read this text, however the use of typography is essential when selecting a font that is relevant and looks suited for the layout of the website.   </p>

              Accessibility
            </h4>
            <p class="card-text">While the website had to be laid out professionally, there was also a need to ensure the layout was easy to navigate and accessible for all audiences, particularly for those that may struggle to navigate a more complex website, or those that have disabilities, impacting their everyday life. More recently, there has been a larger focus on inclusivity, to ensure that no one is excluded from a design, with language and tech ability being two key points of interest when designing; we often tend to structure a website how we would want the website to look, in order to make this as professional and appealing as possible, with less focus on making this inclusive to those with perhaps, other senses or levels of ability. While there is a difference between inclusive designs and accessibility, the website should be designed with the aims of enabling anyone to access this with no struggles. Disabilities can have a large influence on design and structure, with ‘empathy being an important part of many different forms of design’, and ‘when done well, we can recognise more than just the barriers that people encounter,’ (Microsoft Design, 2016). </p>

              Colour theory
            </h4>
            <p class="card-text">– Similar to typography, the importance of colour’s used on the website is essential, with this helping create a professional looking website that appeals to employees; the wrong colour choice in co-ordination with the layout and subject of the website can make it look poorly designed and rushed. For example, using two contrasting bright colours will more than put readers, designers or employees off, and take away from the general subject of what the website is actually covering. Colour can also have certain psychological impacts, due to colours being linked to different emotions: blue is often associated with sadness, in comparison to red being associated with anger or passion. I chose to use a dark yellow, almost golden colour, to contrast against the black and white background, which I think made the text visible enough for readers, whilst also looking professional and suiting the feel of the overall website. Professional web designs will always have a well thought out colour scheme, with ‘the importance of colour design stemming from the significance of colour to the human mind’, and the choice of colour ‘should strengthen the website and branding of the business’ (Jones, 2014). </p>
